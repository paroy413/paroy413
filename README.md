Hi! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! Currently, I'm working on one main project, a character creation and writing program. It's currently private, but when it is further along in the development phase, I will make it public. I plan to add more projects in the future that are also character design/narrative writing oriented. Eventually, I hope to host my own website that will serve as an online portfolio for this project as well as others. Though I'm not primarily a programmer, I want to learn new things and grow via a different discipline, through the program I'm creating right now. My aim is to combine creativity and logic to develop a tool that bridges the gap between the two.
