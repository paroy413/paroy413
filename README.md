Hi! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! Currently, I've only got my main project up, a character creation and writing program (feel free to check it out), but I plan to add more projects in the future, also character design/narrative writing oriented. Eventually, I hope to host my own website that will serve as an online portfolio for this project as well as others. Though I'm not primarily a programmer, I want to learn new things via a different discipline, through the program I'm creating right now. My aim is to combine creativity and logic to develop a tool that bridges the gap between the two.
