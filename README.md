Hi! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! Currently, I've only got my main project up, a character creation and writing tool (feel free to check it out), but I hope to add more projects in the future, also character design/narrative writing oriented. Though I'm not primarily a programmer, I want to learn new things through the program I'm creating right now. Eventually, I hope to have a website up, and on that website, I will host all of my projects in a sort of online portfolio.
